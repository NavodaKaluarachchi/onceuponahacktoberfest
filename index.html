                The day had dawned clear. Perhaps not as clear as the giant that unusually burst from the ground and launched its attack on the dwarven village.<br>
                - Where are the stones? - roared the giant as he tore down the village roofs with the old trunk of a tree.<br> 
                The dwarf soldiers promptly prepared the crossbows and fired at the giant, but it had no effect.
